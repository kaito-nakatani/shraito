Sangeet is one of the most joyful and high-energy pre-wedding celebrations in Indian weddings. The word sangeet literally means "music," and the event is all about celebrating the union of two families through song, dance, and laughter.

During the Sangeet, both sides of the family often prepare dance performances, skits, or songs to celebrate the couple's journey and shared memories. It's a night of bonding, friendly competition, and pure fun. You’ll see colorful outfits, lively Bollywood music, and a lot of heartfelt (and sometimes hilarious) performances.

No rituals here — just a chance for everyone to let loose, celebrate love, and kick off the wedding festivities with joy, rhythm, and togetherness.
