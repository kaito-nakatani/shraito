**[Mehendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi)** is a beautiful and intimate pre-wedding celebration where the couple, family and friends have their hands and feet adorned with intricate henna designs. The mehendi paste, made from powdered henna leaves, is considered cooling, auspicious, and symbolic of joy, love, and protection. Traditionally, the deeper the color of the bride’s mehendi, the more love and luck it is said to bring to her marriage.

The bride’s mehendi is usually the most elaborate, often including hidden initials of the groom woven into the designs for him to find later! Family and friends also receive smaller, elegant designs while enjoying a relaxed and joyful atmosphere filled with music, games, snacks, and laughter.
