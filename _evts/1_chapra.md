The wedding festivities begin with the Chapram pooja at Shreya’s house. During this first ceremony, the family seeks ancestral blessings and decorate the house to commence the celebrations. If you are in Bangalore early, you are invited - please let us know if you would like to attend!

Naandi: Naandi Homa is a sacred fire ritual performed at the beginning of traditional Telugu weddings to invoke blessings from the gods and ancestors. It is typically conducted a day or two before the wedding ceremony. The ritual is meant to ensure that the rest of the wedding events proceed smoothly, without any obstacles. Offerings are made into the holy fire, and prayers are recited to invite positive energy, peace, and prosperity for the couple's new life together. In essence, the Naandi Homa is a spiritual “kickoff” that sets an auspicious tone for the entire wedding celebration.

Chapram pooja: A chhapram is a structure made of coconut leaves, tied together with banana stalks on either end. This structure is tied outside the house that hosts the marriage. A small, intimate pooja (prayer ritual) is performed to bless the chhapram and seek divine protection for the ceremonies to come. The chhapram is a traditional marker that signals the start of the wedding rituals. It serves as a symbolic gateway that transforms an ordinary home into a sacred space for marriage.

Pasupu Kottadam (South Indian Haldi):
Pasupu Kottadam is a joyful and symbolic pre-wedding ritual centered around the use of turmeric (pasupu)—a sacred ingredient in Indian culture believed to purify, protect, and bless. Before the ceremony, turmeric roots are traditionally pounded by the women of the family using a special stone or clay pot. This represents collective effort, ancestral wisdom, and the nurturing strength of women preparing the bride or groom for married life. Once ground into a paste, the turmeric is applied to the bride and groom’s face, hands, and feet in a light-hearted and affectionate gathering of close family and friends. The ritual is meant to cleanse the body and spirit, ward off negativity, and invoke health and prosperity.
