**[Haldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric)** is a cleansing ritual where family and friends come together to apply haldi (turmeric paste) on the bride and groom's face and body, because it is known to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

After the event, we'll be playing with colors in the rain dance area of the venue. If you would like to participate, please wear any clothes that you don't mind getting wet and colored!
