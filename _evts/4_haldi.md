In this ceremony, a paste made of turmeric ([haldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric)), sandalwood, and sometimes rosewater or oil is applied to the bride and groom by their family and friends. Applying it is believed to cleanse and bring a natural glow as they prepare to step into married life. For our wedding, we’re adding a playful twist: after the traditional haldi, we’ll be having a wet haldi and rain dance celebration! Expect upbeat music, water splashes, and bursts of festive color as we all join in the fun.

__Please wear clothes you’re comfortable getting wet in—and keep in mind that colored powders will be used, which may stain fabrics. We recommend wearing something light, fun, and that you don’t mind getting a little messy!__
