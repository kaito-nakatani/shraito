    The word muhurtam refers to the auspicious time chosen by the families and priests for the wedding to take place, based on the couple’s horoscopes. During this ceremony, the bride and groom exchange garlands, are tied together with a sacred thread (called mangalya dharanam), and take vows around a holy fire. Every step holds deep spiritual meaning—signifying love, duty, partnership, and the start of a new life together. Guests will witness ancient rituals that blend devotion and beauty, all while the bride and groom are surrounded by the warmth and blessings of their families.
