The Reception is a formal celebration to introduce the newlyweds to extended family and friends, and to celebrate their union with love, food, and festivity. Unlike the more ritual-heavy events, the reception is a relaxed and elegant evening where guests can meet the couple, offer their blessings, and enjoy a joyful gathering.

There are no traditional ceremonies during this event—it’s all about dressing up, mingling, taking photos with the bride and groom, and enjoying a lavish meal together.
