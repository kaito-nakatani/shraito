The **[haldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric)** ceremony is a cleansing ritual where family and friends come together to apply haldi (turmeric paste) on the bride and groom's face and body, because haldi is known to possesss antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

**[Mehndi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi)**—or henna—is an ancient form of body art, found in India, Egypt, North Africa, East Africa and the Middle East. Professional mehendi artists will be on-site to create beautiful patterns for all our guests!
