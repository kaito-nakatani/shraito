        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>Bangalore has a lot of good food, especially South Indian food. Bangalore also has the best dosas in India [Kishore et. al., 2024]. Here are a few recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vidyarthi Bhavan</strong> — Historic restaurant known for crispy dosas. You usually get a token and wait 20-30min for a table.</li>
                <li><strong>MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Room)</strong> — Iconic restaurant known for serving authentic South Indian food. Try their masala dosa, filter coffee and lunch meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Brahmins Coffee Bar</strong> — Order idli with chutney and filter coffee.</li>
                <li><strong>V V Puram</strong> — Street food with multiple vendors. It is definitely an experience!</li>
                <li><strong>Kappa Chakka Kandhari</strong> — Food from Kerala. Try their cloud pudding.</li>
            </ul>
