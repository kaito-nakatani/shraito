                    <p> Most people can apply for an <strong><a href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html" target="_blank">e-visa</a></strong>, which can be obtained at most 30 days before travel. Make sure to apply using the official Indian Government’s website (ending with .in), and not a third party, as ads on Google might suggest! There are a lot of scam/phishing websites out there. Some might work, but you will be overcharged (and give your passport info to a scammer) unless you use the government website. </p>
                    <p>
                    If your country of origin doesn't support Indian e-visa, please let the couple know! We will do our best to support you.

                    <p>WiFi in Indian airports is a bit annoying: in order to connect to airport wifi, you will need to provide a verification code sent by SMS to a phone number. If you don’t have a working phone connection in India and need to use the airport WiFi, ask the information desk or find a Wi-Fi kiosk. At the information desk, the attendant at the information desk can either give you a one-time use code or use their own mobile device to receive your verification code. At the kiosk, you can scan your passport to receive a one-time code.</p>

                    <p>The currency used in India is the rupee (₹ / INR). India has extensive digital infrastructure, and so credit cards can be used to pay in most places. However, physical money can be useful in some situations (e.g., at street food shops), and so it may be worth exchanging for local currency. Currency can be exchanged at the airport or in the city. The airport is convenient, but may not have the most generous spread.</p>

                    <p>To travel to/from the airport you can use Uber. The airport should have signs directing you to where the Uber pickup spot is. Once you make the booking, you will not be assigned to a specific driver but only given a OTP (one-time password). At the pickup spot, you will give the Uber driver the OTP, and your ride will start!</p>

                    <p>Most carriers offer some sort of an international roaming plan for India. Yet these plans can be relatively expensive; it is likely to be cheaper to get a local SIM in India. Note that, to use a local sim, your phone cannot be carrier-locked. A local SIM may also be purchased in the airport. If you don’t want a physical SIM, there are eSIMs like this one: <a href="https://bytesim.com/">ByteSIM</a>.</p>
