- **Visa.** Most people can apply for an
    <a href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html">e-visa</a>,
    which can be obtained at most 30 days before travel. 
    **Make sure apply using the official Indian Government's website (ending with .in)**, and not a third party, as ads on Google might suggest! There are a lot of scam/phishing websites out there. Some might work, but you will be overcharged (and give your passport info to a scammer) unless you use the government website. 

- **Airport.** Bangalore has one airport (BLR). This is most likey where you will be flying to/from. If plan to travel aroound India before/after the wedding, you can also use trains and busses. **If you'd like transportation to/from Bangalore airport, please indicate this in the RSVP form.**

- **Airport WiFi.** WiFI in Indian airports is a little annoying because to start using the wifi you need to provide a code that's sent to you by SMS. If you don't have a working phone connection in India and need to use the airport WiFi, go to the information desk/ ask at the airport staff. They will either give you a one-time use code or sometimes use their own mobile to get the SMS code. 

- **Vaccines.** Here is the CDC page for recommended vaccines when travelling to India: [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/india](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/india). None of these vaccines are required to enter India, but many might be recommended by your doctor! You can get a travel appointment to get vaccines/anti-malaria pill prescriptions.

- **Currency.** The currency used in India is The Indian rupee (INR). Credit cards can be used to pay in many places. Unless your credit card has a benefit for "no foreign exchange fee", there will be currency exchange fee. Plese check with your bank for more details. It is helpful to have physical money in a few places (like roadside shops), so it might be useful to get some local currency. Currency can be exchanged at the airport or in the city (the airport might offer slightly worse rates).

- **SIM Cards.** Most carriers offer some sort of an international roaming plan for India. These are often expensive and it might be cheaper to get a local sim in India. These sims can be obtained in the airport but the store might require an SMS code to activate the sim. *Note that to use a local sim, your phone cannot be carrier locked.* If you want us to arrange a SIM card for you, let us know on the RSVP form.
