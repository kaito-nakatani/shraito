**Does travel to India require a visa?**  
Yes, for visitors from most countries.


**What gifts would you like? Do you have a registry?**  
We have decided to implement a no gift policy. We are just excited about celebrating with all of you!


**What are good hotels in Bangalore?**  
For guests from out of town, accomodation will be provided on 16th, 17th and 18th. Rooms will be available in the afternoon on the 16th and need to be vacated in morning of the 19th. Late chekout is unfortunately not available because the venue has another event on the 19th.

**What will the weather be like?**  
Bangalore in January should be cool and pleasant days with daytime temperatures around 27°C (80°F) and evening temperatures around 15°C (59°F).  
*Despite the appearance of our website's landing page, it is unlikely to rain in January.*

**Is there parking for the ceremony and reception?**  
Yes, there is parking availanle at the venue (Tamarind Tree).

**What if I have dietary restrictions?**  
Please let us know of any dietary restrictions or allergies when you RSVP. We'll try our best to accommodate all dietary needs. 

**Is there a dress code?**  
There are attire recommendations below each event on the events page. These are certainly not required and are just suggestions. If you are interested in purchasing Indian clothes here are two streets in Bangalore where there are multiple shops that you can check out, such as:

{:.slim}
- Commercial Street, and
- Jaynagar 4th Block.

You should also keep an eye out for informally oganized shopping trips before the wedding.  

**How can I get around Bangalore?**  
Getting around Bangalore is not too hard and most rides within the city cost between ₹200-500 ($2.50-$6). We recommend either of the following:
- *Uber / Ola* (Ride-Hailing Apps): Both apps work just like Uber does internationally. 
- *Auto-Rickshaws* These are iconic yellow and black three-wheelers. You can usually hail these down on the street but you would then have to communicate with the driver (usually in Kannada) to tell the driver where you are going and to negotiate a price. An easier alternative is to book autos through the Uber/Ola app.  

**Any tips for travelling to India?**  
Yes, please take a look at the Travel Info page. 

**What are some local attractions and recommendations?**  
Please take a look at the recommendations page.
