**Does travel to India require a visa?**  
Yes, for visitors from most countries. More information can be found on the [Travel Info](/{{ site.baseurl }}tabs/travel-info.html) page.


**What gifts would you like? Do you have a registry?**  
We have decided to implement a no gift policy. We are just excited about celebrating with all of you!


**What are good hotels in Bangalore?**  
For guests from out of town, accommodation will be provided on 16th, 17th and 18th. Rooms will be available in the afternoon on the 16th and need to be vacated in morning of the 19th. Late checkout is unfortunately not available because the venue has another event on the 19th. If you are planning on being in bangalore for additional dates before and after the wedding, here are a few hotels close to Varsha's house that you can take a look at:

{:.slim}
- [Hotel Greenpark](https://hotelgreenpark.com/bengaluru/) (about $110/night)
- [Lilac Hotel](https://lilachotels.com/) - 3rd Block Jaynagar and 5th Block Jaynagar (about $70/night)
- [Fountain Tree By TGI](https://www.tgihotels.com/fountain-tree-jp-nagar-bangalore/) (about $50/night)

Depending on what kind of rooms you are looking for, you will be able to find less/more expensive hotels. Ask Varsha if you have any specific questions.

**What will the weather be like?**  
Bangalore in January should be cool and pleasant days with daytime temperatures around 27°C (80°F) and evening temperatures around 15°C (59°F).  
*Despite the appearance of our website's landing page, it is unlikely to rain in January.*

**Is there parking for the ceremony and reception?**  
Yes, there is parking available at the venue ([Tamarind Tree](https://www.thetamarindtree.in/)).

**What if I have dietary restrictions?**  
Please let us know of any dietary restrictions or allergies when you RSVP. We'll try our best to accommodate all dietary needs. 

**Is there a dress code? Can I shop for Indian clothes?**  
There are attire recommendations below each event on the [Events](/{{ site.baseurl }}tabs/events.html) page. These are certainly not required and are just suggestions. If you are interested in purchasing Indian clothes, here are two streets in Bangalore where there are multiple shops that you can check out:

{:.slim}
- Commercial Street, and
- Jaynagar 4th Block.

You should also keep an eye out for informally organized shopping trips before the wedding.  

**How can I get around Bangalore?**  
Getting around Bangalore is not too hard and most rides within the city cost between ₹100 and ₹500 (which is $1-$6). Here are some options:
- *Uber / Ola* (Ride-Hailing Apps): Both apps work just like Uber and Lyft do in the US. 
- *Auto-Rickshaws*: These are iconic yellow and black three-wheelers. You can usually hail these down on the street but you would then have to communicate with the driver (usually in Kannada) to tell the driver where you are going and to negotiate a price. An easier alternative is to book autos through the Uber/Ola app.  
- *Metro*: Some places in Bangalore are accessible via [Metro](https://english.bmrc.co.in/). The metro is fairly new and therefore does not cover the whole city yet.

**Any tips for travelling to India?**

**What are some local attractions and recommendations?**  
Please take a look at the [Recommendations](/{{ site.baseurl }}tabs/recos.html) page.
