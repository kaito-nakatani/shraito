            <strong>What are good hotels in Bangalore?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer">
            For guests from out of town, accommodation will be provided on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th. Rooms will be available in the afternoon on the 3rd and need to be vacated by the evening of the 6th. Late checkout is unfortunately not available because the venue has another event on the 6th. If you are planning on being in Bangalore for additional dates before and after the wedding, here are a few hotels close to Shreya's house for your consideration:
            <ul class="slim">
                <li>Hotel Greenpark (about $110/night)</li>
                <li>Lilac Hotel - 3rd Block Jayanagar and 5th Block Jayanagar (about $70/night)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are many more hotels around Church Street. Depending on what kind of rooms you are looking for, you will be able to find hotels that are less or more expensive. The options listed above are fairly basic hotels, and might be good choices if you are going to be out all day exploring the city. If you want to stay in a nicer resort/hotel, there are fancier options. Ask Shreya if you have any specific questions.</p>

            <strong>Is there a dress code? Can I shop for Indian clothes?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer">
            There are attire recommendations below each event on the <a href="/{{ site.baseurl }}tabs/events.html">Events</a> page and <a href="/{{ site.baseurl }}tabs/recos.html", class="internal-link">clothes section</a> in the recommendation page. These are certainly not required and are just suggestions. If you are interested in purchasing Indian clothes, here are two streets in Bangalore where there are multiple shops that you can check out:
            <ul class="slim">
                <li>Commercial Street, and</li>
                <li>Jaynagar 4th Block.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let the couple know if you have any questions!</p>

            <strong>How can I get around Bangalore?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer">
            Getting around Bangalore is not too hard and most rides within the city cost between ₹100 and ₹500 (which is $1-$6). Here are some options:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uber / Ola / Rapido (Ride-Hailing Apps):</strong> All three apps work just like Uber. There is a one-day option in Uber app if you plan to be out all day.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto-Rickshaws:</strong> These are iconic yellow and black three-wheelers. You can usually hail these down on the street but you would then have to communicate with the driver (usually in Kannada) to tell the driver where you are going and to negotiate a price. An easier alternative is to book autos through the Uber/Ola app.</li>
                <li><strong>Metro:</strong> Some places in Bangalore are accessible via Metro. The metro is fairly new and therefore does not cover the whole city yet.</li>
            </ul>
