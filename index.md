Varsha Kishore
and 
Oli(ver) Richardson
are getting married to one another.

Varsha and Oli met in Grad School at Cornell. 
They have spent six years together (including the pandemic) and have discovered:
       	       Varsha exploits; Oli explores
Varsha reliably executes; Oli sometimes has crazy ideas
Varsha likes content; Oli likes style
They complement one another and are excited to commit to a lifetime of partnership. 


The ceremony will be 
in 
[Bangalore, India](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XyncfmUAKSynTgSL7)
at 
[the Tamarind Tree](https://www.thetamarindtree.in/)
on January 16th, 2024.
We hope you can join us!
