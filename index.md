        Shreya reliably makes things work; Kaito sometimes has brilliant ideas.
        Shreya finds the best things; Kaito finds the most unique ones.
        Shreya likes content; Kaito likes form.
        
        After growing up on opposite sides of the earth, Shreya and Kaito met in graduate school.
        They are remarkably similar people with very different strengths.
        They have become an excellent team in their years together,
        and are excited to commit to a lifetime of partnership!
